 * - All state changes must happen in actions (prevents accidental mutations)
 * - Computed values cannot have side effects (ensures purity)
 * - Observables must be accessed within reactions (helps catch missing observers)
 *
 * This file is imported early in the application lifecycle to configure MobX
